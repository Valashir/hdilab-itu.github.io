# Human Data Interaction Lab
The Human Data Interaction Lab focuses on the human factors in the conception, use, and understanding of data. The lab functions as a venue for discussing matters related to human data interaction broadly and invites students and faculty to join forces to better understand these aspects.

## People and affiliated research groups
About twenty people are affiliated with the lab (see also [People](/people). There is a sizeable overlap with members of the research group [Human-Centered Data Science](https://hcds.itu.dk). Reach out if you're interested in becoming a part of the lab!

## Events
This semester, we are launching our weekly data jams. See more at [Data Jams](/data-jams).
