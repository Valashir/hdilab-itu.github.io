# People in the lab

We are a group of about twenty students and faculty affiliated with the lab, some of which are also members of the hcds research group. 

Many of us are in the lab during the week as our offices are nearby (for example, PhD students, postdocs, and faculty). Bachelors and Master's students come by for a cup of coffee, to work from the hot-desks, or to meet for supervision or other collaborations.

If you are interested in joining us, please reach out!
