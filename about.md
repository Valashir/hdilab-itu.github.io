The hdilab 

# History
The lab emerged from the ashes of the Data Science & Society (DSS) lab, which existed from 2017 to 2020. The focus of the DSS lab was to bridge the gap from academia society and industry and allow students and researchers to work on real-world data with cutting edge methodologies. Former members of the DSS lab includes Luca Rossi, Natalie Schluter, Obaida Hanteer, Sami Brandt, Jes Frellsen, Oliver Müller, Christina Neumayer, Irina Shklovski, Rasmus Pagh, Aske Kammer, and Paolo Burelli. 

As the members of the DSS lab relocated and Aske Mottelson, Søren Knudsen, and Luca Rossi founded the [Human-Centered Data Science research group](https://hcds.itu.dk) in 2021, the ideas for a lab pivot materialised. As part of this change, we discussed how we could establish a stronger physical presence for the lab and the possibilities this would provide, both for interaction betwen students and faculty and for doing more tangible research and teaching in the context of the lab. We discussed these early ideas with department management, from which the idea to embed parts of the 4D corridor into our lab was formed. During 2022, we remodelled the third nook of the corridor with a large display for collaborative work, presentations, and prototyping, as well as hang-out spaces and hot desks for visitors.

Thai Wang started as our lab assistant in 2023, which is when we also started to organize our weekly data jams. This site was constructed to communicate these events.

Formally, we changed our name to the Human Data Interaction Lab on April 1, 2023.
